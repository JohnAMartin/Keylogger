# Keylogger
This is a keylogger that I created, it will capture them and make a csv file in the same directory where the keylogger is stored

Will have an updated keylogger as I am going to set it for a windows machine, hide it in the appdata folder (which is a hidden folder) and then email it back to us.  
This is of course in the future

As Always, these tools and all tools are for education purposes only
